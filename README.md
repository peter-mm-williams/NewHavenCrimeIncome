# NewHavenCrimeIncome
### Project visualizing the trends in crime and income for different census tracts of New Haven, CT.
* Loads data from csv files sourced from FBI (https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s) and census (https://data.census.gov/)
* Cleans and merges data
* Hosts interactive figure displaying the distribution of incomes for a given census tract and plots recent trends for a given crime statistic and the fraction of the population in a selected income bracket
* Identifies that a decrease in the fraction of households in lowest income bracket was coincident to a drop in aggravated assault and larceny rates in the downtown census tracts of New Haven (r $>$ 0.8) suggesting a connection between these crimes and desperation
